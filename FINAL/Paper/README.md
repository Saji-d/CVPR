# CVPR

AIUB Course Assignment – Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)

## Overview

This repository contains the final submission for the CVPR course project.  
The project explores multiple computer vision tasks using deep learning and classical techniques, including digit recognition, face recognition, and real-time face recognition using convolutional neural networks and modern architectures.

The repository includes:
- The final project paper
- Jupyter notebooks for model training, experimentation, and evaluation

## Models and Experiments

- **Digit Recognition (CNN)**  
  Implementation of a convolutional neural network for handwritten digit classification.

- **Face Recognition (LBPH + OpenCV)**  
  Classical face recognition approach using Local Binary Pattern Histograms.

- **Real-Time Face Recognition (EfficientNet)**  
  Deep learning–based real-time face recognition system using EfficientNet.

Each notebook includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.
